## Astrophotography Image Processor

# Overview

The _Astrophotography Image Processor_ is a Python application designed to process and enhance astrophotography images. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that allows user to adjust image properties such as brightness, contrast, and color saturation. This tool is ideal for amateur astronomors and photography enthusiasts who want to fine-tune their astrophotography images with a range of customizable settings. This ongoing project is inspired by my personal life-long interests of both astronomy and photography, and will receive periodic updates as my skills evolve within the Python language.
