# Astrophotography Image Processor

## Overview
The *Astrophotography Image Processor* is a Python application designed to process and enhance astrophotography images. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that allows user to adjust image properties such as brightness, contrast, and color saturation. This tool is ideal for amateur astronomors and photography enthusiasts who want to fine-tune their astrophotography images with a range of customizable settings. The ongoing project was inspired by my personal life-long interests of both astronomy and photography, and will receive periodic updates.

## Features
- **Image Loading and Display**: Open and display astrophotography images in various formats (e.g. PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- **Brightness Adjustment**: Modify the brightness of the image using a slider
- **Contrast Adjustment**: Adjust the contrast of the image with a slider
- **Saturation Adjustment**: Control the color saturation of the image using a slider
- **Resize Image**: Change the size of the image with a resize factor slider
- **Save Processed Image**: Save the processed version of the image to a file
- **Zoom Functionality**: Zoom in and out of the image using a mouse wheel scroll
