This program demonstrates using a JSON dataset that represents all the earthquakes that have occured across the globe during the previous month. A map has also been created to show the location and significance of each of these earthquakes.

A Plotly mapping tool has been utilized for this location-based data, creating a visualization that shows the global distribution of earthquakes.

The dataset used has been downloaded from a United States Geological Survey's earthquake data feed, found at: https://earthquake.usgs/gov/earthquakes/feed/.
