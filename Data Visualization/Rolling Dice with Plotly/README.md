## Rolling Dice with Plotly

This project utilizes the Python package Plotly to produce interactive visualizations. The end result creates a visualization to be displayed in a web browser, scaling automatically to fit the viewer's screen. The user can hover over any of the elements on the screen, highlighting that element's information.

In this project, the results of rolling dice are analyzed. When you roll one regular, six-sided die, you have an equal chance of rolling any of the numbers from 1 through 6. When you use two dice, you are more likely to roll certain numbers more than others. The aim of this program is to determine which numbers are more likely to occur by generating data that represents rolling dice. The results are plotted.
